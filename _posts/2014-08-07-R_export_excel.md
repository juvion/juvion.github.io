####An R function to write multiple table into excel.
Very often, when I want to save my dataset as a spreadsheet, I export them one by one as separate .csv file. Today, 
I generated multiple really close but different subsets of data, so I want to put them into a single excel file for 
my report. Then I googled and found this method. Besides, the author mentioned a R package [xlsx][2] can do all sorts 
of works related to excel. 

> One solution was to write a wrapper for write.xlsx() function in the xlsx package. (from [r-blooger.com][1], by Rob Kabacoff)

```r
save.xlsx <- function (file, ...)
  {
      require(xlsx, quietly = TRUE)
      objects <- list(...)
      fargs <- as.list(match.call(expand.dots = TRUE))
      objnames <- as.character(fargs)[-c(1, 2)]
      nobjects <- length(objects)
      for (i in 1:nobjects) {
          if (i == 1)
              write.xlsx(objects[[i]], file, sheetName = objnames[i])
          else write.xlsx(objects[[i]], file, sheetName = objnames[i],
              append = TRUE)
      }
      print(paste("Workbook", file, "has", nobjects, "worksheets."))
}

save.xlsx("myworkbook.xlsx", mtcars, Titanic, AirPassengers, state.x77)
```
> should save the R objects mtcars (a data frame),  Titanic (a table),  AirPassengers (a time series) 
and state.x77 (a matrix) to the workbook myworkbook.xlsx. Each object should be in itâ€™s own worksheet 
and the worksheet should take on the name of the object.
