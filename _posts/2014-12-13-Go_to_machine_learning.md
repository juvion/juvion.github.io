#Go to machine learning
Hey guys, we have finished EdX online StatX2.1, StatX2.2 from Berkeley, and now we are diving into StatX2.3. 
That's a great achievement.  
<br>
Since we are going to be prepared with a good amount of statistics knowledge, I think it will be reasonable to 
move to next Data Science course. Here we go, Machine learning course!!   
Here are some online course that might be worth to look at.  

**Resources:**

- Coursera: [Machine Learning][1], Andrew Ng, Stanford University.  
- Udacity: [Intro to Machine Learning][2], Sebastian Thrun, Stanford University.
- Stanford Online: [Statistical Learning][3], Trevor Hastie & Rob Tibshirani, Stanford University.

It seems, in ML field, Stanford definitely rules.   
I actually did a very quick taste on all these three courses. For each of them, the one sentence summary, 
which will be very subjective, is --  

- Coursera's one is very much tutor-to-student like course, and it covers a lot.  
- Udacity course is very organized and well prepared, but it is less extensive.  
- Stanford online course, is very much like a serious university course, and it has very extensive content, 
plus two experienced professor prepared it. 

I feel that I will be easily attracted and following Udacity's course, but I think from Stanford Online, 
I will get much more serious training, especially with our group studying.
